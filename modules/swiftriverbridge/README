In this directory I would expect to see the Ushahidi plugin code that
accessed the local install of Swiftriver.

I would expect this to be a mixture of Ushahidi centric classes and functions
with function names that match the operations that Ushahidi id expecting:

for example:

A class called SwiftriverSourceBridge

with function like:

listalltwitterhastags()
savetwitterhashtags()
listallfeeds()
savefeedlist()

etc.

Then I would expect to see the code from the SwiftriverLocalAPIHook folder that
offers Swiftriver centric functions.

This structure allows Ushahidi developers to use Switriver without having to
know the inner workings of Swiftriver.

It's your job to write the code in the Ushahidi centric classes to allow this
to happen.
